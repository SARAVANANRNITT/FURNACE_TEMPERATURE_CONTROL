# FURNACE_TEMPERATURE_CONTROL
World-class MATLAB/Simulink simulation for Furnace Temperature Control with energy recovery, integrating advanced neural network-based controllers for adaptive process optimization. Includes subsystem models (feed, fuel, air, sensors, PID, heat exchanger), performance benchmarking, and industry-ready documentation.


# Furnace Temperature Control with Energy Recovery – Intelligent Control Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project models and simulates a **DCU Furnace Temperature Control System** with **Energy Recovery**, built in **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
The simulation demonstrates:
- Realistic furnace process modelling.
- Integration of a **Heat Exchanger** for feed preheating.
- Advanced control using **Neural Networks** (NN-based PID tuning) compared against a traditional PID controller.
- Adaptive response to disturbances and energy savings.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Achieve a more stable furnace outlet temperature than conventional industrial logic.
- Improve energy efficiency through heat recovery.
- Demonstrate integration of intelligent control (Neural Network) in a high-fidelity simulation.
- Provide a professional, well-documented, portfolio-ready project.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Feed Subsystem** – adjustable flow and initial feed temperature.
- **Fuel & Air Subsystem** – combustion input control.
- **Sensors** – realistic temperature/flow sensors with time lag and accuracy limits.
- **Thermal Furnace Dynamics** – heat transfer, process delays, and load changes.
- **Heat Exchanger** – recovers exhaust heat to preheat incoming feed.
- **Controllers** – PID and NN-based adaptive control.
- **Fault & Disturbance Simulation** – sensor drift, load changes, and feed composition changes.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the `.slx` Simulink model in MATLAB.
3. Run the simulation and explore:
- PID vs NN control
- Energy savings from the heat exchanger
- Fault and disturbance scenarios

## 📊 Performance & Results
The NN-based controller adapts PID gains in real time, showing:
- Reduced overshoot
- Faster settling time
- Enhanced disturbance rejection
- Measurable fuel savings

(Plots, simulation screenshots, and performance tables will be added after final benchmarking.)
