## üìå Executive Summary

This repository presents a world-class MATLAB/Simulink simulation of an industrial furnace control system, grounded in a real-world industrial challenge from an internship at **Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL)**. The project focuses on stabilizing the outlet temperature of a **Delayed Coker Unit (DCU) furnace**, a critical process in petroleum refining.

Beyond standard PID control, this model incorporates an **energy recovery heat exchanger** and serves as a digital testbed for developing and benchmarking **advanced intelligent controllers**, including a **Neural Network-based adaptive PID tuner**.

This repository showcases:
*   **High-Fidelity Process Modeling:** A modular, subsystem-based approach to simulating complex industrial dynamics.
*   **Real-World Problem Solving:** A solution directly addressing documented process instabilities (`¬±50¬∞C` temperature swings).
*   **Energy Efficiency:** A functional model of a heat exchanger for feed preheating, demonstrating significant energy savings.
*   **Intelligent Control Integration:** A clear roadmap and foundational work for applying AI/ML (Neural Networks) to legacy control problems.

## üéØ The Industrial Challenge: A Case Study from CPCL

In a modern refinery, process stability is paramount. This project is based on a significant operational challenge observed at a DCU furnace, which exhibited persistent temperature fluctuations of approximately **¬±50¬∞C** around the critical process target of **580¬∞C**.

This instability is not a minor issue; it has severe consequences:

*   üî• **Inefficient Thermal Cracking:** Inconsistent temperatures lead to suboptimal breakdown of heavy hydrocarbons, reducing the yield and quality of valuable products like naphtha and diesel.
*   ‚õΩ **Wasted Energy & Increased Costs:** The control system consumes excess fuel in an attempt to correct deviations, leading to higher operational costs and emissions.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Equipment Stress & Safety Risks:** Large temperature swings cause thermal stress on the furnace tubes, increasing the risk of coking, tube rupture, and costly unscheduled shutdowns.

## üí° The Solution: A Modular, High-Fidelity Simulink Model

To address this challenge, a dynamic, closed-loop simulation was architected in Simulink. The model's philosophy is rooted in a **modular, subsystem-based design**, where each block represents a distinct physical or logical component of the real-world system. This approach allows for isolated testing, clear visualization of signal flow, and easy expansion.

### Detailed Subsystem Breakdown

*   **`Feed_System`**: Simulates the flow, pressure, and temperature of the heavy residual oil feedstock. It includes models for actuator dynamics (control valves) and is designed to accept process disturbances (e.g., changes in feed temperature) to test controller robustness.

*   **`Fuel_System` & `Air_System`**: These subsystems model the delivery of fuel and combustion air to the furnace burners. The air-to-fuel ratio is critical for complete and efficient combustion. These flows are the primary manipulated variables for the control loops.

*   **`Furnace Thermal Block`**: This is the heart of the simulation. It is a mathematical representation of the furnace's complex heat transfer dynamics. It receives energy inputs from the combustion process and calculates the resulting **Furnace Outlet Temperature** and internal **Furnace Pressure**.

*   **`Heat Exchanger`**: A critical component for energy efficiency. This subsystem models a heat exchanger that recovers energy from the hot furnace outlet stream to preheat the cold incoming feed. This reduces the overall energy demand on the furnace burners.

*   **`Sensors`**: To ensure the simulation is realistic, this subsystem mimics the behavior of industrial sensors (transmitters). It introduces **time lags** and **process noise**, forcing the controller to operate with the same imperfect information it would have in a real plant.

*   **`Controllers`**: The "brain" of the simulation. This subsystem contains both a baseline **industrial PID controller** and the framework for advanced controllers. It receives measured signals from the `Sensors` block, compares them to setpoints, and sends corrective signals to the `Fuel_System` and `Air_System`.

## üìä Performance & Key Results

The baseline PID control strategy, when properly tuned using this model, successfully mitigates the initial instability. Key performance indicators achieved in the simulation include:

*   **Temperature Stabilization:** The furnace outlet temperature is held stable at the **580¬∞C** setpoint with minimal deviation.
*   **Pressure Control:** The internal furnace pressure is maintained at a slight positive pressure (**~1.2 bar**) to ensure stable combustion and prevent air ingress.
*   **Combustion Efficiency:** The flue gas oxygen content is controlled within the optimal **2-5%** range, indicating efficient and complete combustion.
